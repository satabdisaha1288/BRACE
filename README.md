The paper "Bayesian compositional regression with flexible microbiome feature aggregation and selection" presents a novel method, Bayesian Regression with Agglomerated Compositional Effects using a dirichLET process (BRACElet) for rare feature clustering and variable selection in high dimensional compositional regression models.

# Required Functions
This directory has all the functions required for running scripts Simulation.R and RunBRACElet.R

# Other files
* Simulation.R simulates data for an example case study.
* RunBRACElet.R runs BRACElet for the simulated data example with compositional predictors and a continuous response.
* ProcessOutputs.R processes the outputs returned by RunBRACElet.R and calculates the performance metrics.
